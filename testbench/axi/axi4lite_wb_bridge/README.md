## Description
This is the testbench for the AXI4 Lite to Wishbone bridge core [axi4lite_wb_bridge](../../modules/axi/axi4lite_wb_bridge/xaxi4lite_wb_bridge.vhd).
In this core, the Master is AXI4 Lite and Slave is Wishbone.

NOTE: By default, the simulation time is 4ms. To change this, run the test and pass the simulation time as an argument (integer) to this script:
```console
./run.sh <simulation time>
```
